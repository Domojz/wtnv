I have no idea how to use git. If you have suggestions or additions please just send them to domojz-vance.tumblr.com
I'm trying to get a mac downloadable exec up, but idk if it's going to work.
If anyone knows how to compile this for windows (it should compile easily??) feel free and send me the link, i don't have a Windows machine.
Again, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO USE GIT
